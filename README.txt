It's just my personal attempt, the beginning of it, to make Deviantart Eclipse
more comfortable. Simple things can be fixed by custom CSS and elementary DOM
manipulations. More complex stuff requires more efforts, of course.

Idk how far I'll take it, hope the things being fixed natively by the DA devs.
